# Environment Variables Configuration
# ============================================

# --- JWT Configuration ---
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret-key-min-256-bits
# Generate with: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
# This key is used to sign and verify JWT tokens for authentication
# Keep this key secure and rotate periodically

# --- SuperAdmin Self-Service Signup ---
SUPERADMIN_SECRET_KEY=your-superadmin-secret-key-min-32-chars
# Generate with: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
# This key is required to create SuperAdmin accounts via /api/superadmin/signup
# Keep this key extremely secure - it grants platform-wide administrator access
# Share only with authorized personnel who need to create SuperAdmin accounts
# Rotate this key periodically (every 90 days recommended)

# --- SuperAdmin Direct Credentials (Optional) ---
SUPERADMIN_EMAIL=admin@proton.com  # Optional: auto-create SuperAdmin on startup
SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD=SecurePassword123!  # Optional: must meet password strength requirements
# These credentials are OPTIONAL. If you do not set both values, fall back to the secret key method.
# When both email and password are provided, the application auto-creates the SuperAdmin account
# the first time it starts. The password must satisfy the same strength policy (8+ chars, uppercase,
# lowercase, number, special character). The account is created with status='approved' and is immediately
# active. If the account already exists, no action is taken (idempotent behavior). This method is ideal
# for automated deployments, Docker containers, and CI/CD environments. For production, generate a strong
# password with: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(16))". Never commit real credentials
# to source control—store them in a secure secrets manager.
# SECURITY WARNING: SuperAdmin accounts have full access. Protect these credentials using password managers,
# secret vaults, or encrypted storage and restrict access to authorized personnel only.
